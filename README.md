# Predicting-Credit-Card-Default-to-Mitigate-Financial-Risk
Developed an end-to-end TensorFlow model to predict credit card default, achieving a 0.769 AUC on a 30,000-record dataset through a robust Scikit-learn preprocessing pipeline.  Optimized model performance with KerasTuner and leveraged SHAP for explainability, identifying key default drivers to provide actionable business insights.
Predicting Credit Card Default to Mitigate Financial Risk ðŸ’³
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project aimed at predicting credit card payment defaults. The model analyzes historical customer data to forecast the probability of default in the next month, enabling financial institutions to manage risk proactively.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Financial institutions face the risk of loan defaults when customers are unable to repay their credit card debt. This leads to heavy financial losses and affects banking stability. This project aims to use Deep Learning to predict whether a customer is likely to default on their payments in the next month.
